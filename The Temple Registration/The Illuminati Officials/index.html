                                                <p><strong>FACTS CONCERNING ILLUMINATI ORDER</strong></p>
                                                <p><strong>APPLICANT MUST READ THE FOLLOWING</strong></p>
                                                <p align="left">Having expressed a desire to become a member of the Illuminati society, we presume you are willing to 
                                                consider thoroughly the step you propose to take. The exact nature of our Institution being unknown to you, 
                                                we deem it advisable that you should be informed on certain points, the knowledge of which may affect 
                                                your decision to apply for membership. </p>

                                                <p align="left">The essence of Illumination lies in the word “Becoming”. Religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam 
                                                are based on “Being”. Those who understand the difference between being and becoming will start to see 
                                                how illumination offers a radically different worldview, one that is utterly breath-taking in the opportunities 
                                                it offers to humanity</p>

                                                <p align="left">Your research on the Illuminati via the internet has led you to us, however you need to carefully select what 
                                                you read about the Illuminati Order as many of the articles you will find are hearsay.
                                                Conspiracy Theorists have tried to decipher the Illuminati’s code, and by branding the order as domineering, 
                                                demonic worshipping clans in order to gain greed, success and power are a fallacy.
                                                Video’s spilling blood and containing satanic rituals are also a false representation of the order and anyone 
                                                who wishes to believe these unorthodox episodes will never be approached or guided to be a part of the 
                                                order</p>

                                                <p align="left">We think it advisable to inform you that your admission to our society will entail certain financial obligations 
                                                which you should be able to discharge without detriment to yourself or those dependent on you. In addition 
                                                to the fees payable on your entrance, there will be need to make sacrifices. Before presenting this 
                                                application form, be sure in your heart that you are not prompted by mere curiosity. You should be able at 
                                                any moment – to sacrifice what you are today, for what you will become.
                                                I hereby certify on my honour that all these answers are true and correct, and that I have read, understood
